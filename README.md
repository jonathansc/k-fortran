# k-fortran
This is an educational Fortran implementation of k-means clustering.

Honestly I just wanted to try out Fortran.
If I find the time in the future I will try to add a parallel implementation to compare performance and visualize results.

## Utilities 
The utils.py file offers utilities to generate a dataset with different parameters, ready to be parsed by Fortran, and visualize the clustering output.
